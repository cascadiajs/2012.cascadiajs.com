How To Submit A Proposal
========================

* Create a **Github account** if you don't have one already
* **Fork this repository**
* **Create and commit a .MD file** in this directory named after the talk title and your Github ID. For example, if your talk is called "Intro To Node.js" and your Github ID is **janedoe**, name the file ~/proposal/**intro-to-nodejs_janedoe.md** (Checkout the [example template](https://github.com/cascadiajs/cascadiajs.github.com/blob/master/proposal/proposal-template_janedoe.md))
* **Commit an image of yourself** in this directory, named after your github id. Format should be PNG, 256x256 Eg: ~/proposal/**janedoe.png**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request**
* **Send an email** to [carter.rabasa@gmail.com](mailto:carter.rabasa@gmail.com) to introduce yourself and so that we have a way to contact you if your talk is accepted.
* **Wait patiently** (and *nicely*) for us to get back to you. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's just to say "Thanks but no thanks".


What should be in the proposal?
-------------------------------

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information: 

* Your Full Name
* Your Availability (what days/times you are able to do this presentation)
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Presentation Duration (in minutes/hours/days)

If would be great if you could add in a short **personal bio** (50 words or less) and other details like links to your **blog**, **twitter account**, **open source projects**, **company**, or what have you, that's completely up to you. Whatever floats your boat. Bios are nice! :)

To make this easier, we've created a template you can copy and modify. See **proposal-template_jane-doe.md** in this directory.

If you have any other artifacts that relate to your presentation, like slide decks, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory named the same as the .MD file from above, and put related files in there. For example, if my proposal was saved in **intro-to-nodejs_janedoe.md**, I would place the example code in **~/cascadiajs.github.com/proposal/intro-to-nodejs_janedoe/example-code.js** 


What are we looking for?
------------------------

We're looking for anything related to Javascript or Node.js. It can be a five minute lightening talk, an hour long presentation or a song and dance routine with flying ostriches (as long as the lyrics are about Javascript). 

We're also open to suggestions for unconference topics. For example, suppose you really want to talk about MongoDB in Node.js but don't have a presentation, maybe just some questions or experiences to share? We can set aside a block of time and space for your topic. Anyone can show up who wants to discuss the topic. We're flexible.


Other Stuff
