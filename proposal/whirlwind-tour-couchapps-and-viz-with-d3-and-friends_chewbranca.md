[Whirlwind Tour of CouchApp Visualizations with D3 and Friends]
========================

* Speaker   : [Russell Branca]
* Available : [Nov 8th and 9th]
* Duration  : [45-60 mins]

Description
-----------

CouchApps are an interesting way of attaching self contained
applications together with data in a CouchDB database. This talk will
demonstrate how to leverage modern visualization tools such as D3,
Cubism and Crossfilter to do client side data processing and
visualization on top of server side distributed MapReduce processing
with CouchDB.

You'll see how you can create powerful, two tier applications on top of
a distributed database, allowing you to deploy on hosting providers
with no server installs.

If you have a local CouchDB install on your laptop, you will be able
to replicate the application and play along as we go.
