Require.js To Tame Your JavaScript
==================================

* Speaker   : Merrick Christensen
* Available : Anytime
* Duration  : 30 - 45 minutes (Flexible)

Description
-----------

The AMD specification and [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) go a long way towards helping you write more maintainable JavaScript. We'll look at leveraging Require.js and AMD modules to tame your JavaScript. This talk will offer a brief introduction to the AMD specification APIs, then dive into the most powerful features of Require.js. 

Here is a list of things we will explore:

1. Errbacks, catching errors and responding gracefully. Examples: Restarting a feature. Fallback loading when a CDN goes down.

2. Using plugins as middleware to preprocess your JavaScripts. Examples: CoffeeScript. Non-AMD Scripts.

3. Using plugins to load different types of dependencies like CSS and templates.

4. The Require.js plugin API, writing a plugin.

5. Require.js at build time, using r.js to optimize your project. Dead code removal & preprocessing with plugins.

After this presentation, you will be better equipped to write and maintain large scale JavaScript applications for the browser.

I am a JavaScript developer at Domo reinventing the way people do business. I am a strong proponent for open source software and have been obsessively interested in writing maintainable rich clients for the browser since I was in diapers (not entirely true). 

Concerned about my qualification? [Check it son](http://merrickchristensen.com/work.html)... you're welcome.
