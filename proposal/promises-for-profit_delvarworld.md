What are javascript promises? When should you use them? Do they make your code
cleaner (probably)? What are their benefits? What are their downsides? Where do
promises show true power? How do you use them in jQuery? How do you use them in
NodeJS? How do we use them at Crowdtilt? In what version of jQuery should you
ignore promises because they are terrible and broken? All these questions
anwered and nothing else if you accept Andrew Ray's "Promises for Profit" talk!
