Excel in the Browser

* Available : Nov 8-9th, 10am-6pm
* Duration  : 30min

Description
-----------

A little over a year ago we started a very ambitious project at Simply
Measured. We built an Excel spreadsheet viewer in JavaScript. We took
the Excel reports we already had and added them to our web app. I’ll
talk about:

* How to approach building and maintaining a large front-end JavaScript library
* How functional programming and JSON will save you time and stress
* What happens when your UI Designers work in Excel and your Analysts become programmers
