Description
-----------

"Launch now, deal with the design later."  
Right?  
Wrong!  
The first impression that users get of your new project could very well be their 
last if you don't do some work to get a clean and uncluttered interface.  
Even when you're building a prototpe, it helps to build a well laid out interface
right from the begining to avoid getting used to the "localhost" design.
