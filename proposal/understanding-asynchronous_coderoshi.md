Understanding Asynchronous
========================

* Speaker   : Eric Redmond
* Available : Any
* Duration  : 30 mins

Description
-----------

Asynchronous development is both the core power, and major frustration of working in javascript. We'll begin with the fundamental issues people face when confronted writing async code for the first time, moving onto the more insidious problems you'll encounter without a firm grasp of how the callback loop actually functions. We'll end with several classes of solutions to the problems of callbacks and waits, from promises/defers and await queues, up to code generating languages with flow control, like icedcoffeescript.
