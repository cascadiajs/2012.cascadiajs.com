Warning: Unconference material ahead! But it does involve JavaScript.

I'm honestly afraid of missing everything cool.

Our brains initially start with a blank state when we are born.  As we mature,
 we become pre-dispositioned to avoid people we think are different than us.
 We often shoot new ideas down without thought, or because we don't have
 the perspective to tackle problems in a different way.  Our mental shortcuts,
 or 'heuristics', are incredibly useful for some sets of problems. **Too often,
 I think we, or at least I personally, arrive at the conclusion of "I can't do this".**

I'm wrong. You and I **can** do it. We don't have to tell each other lies that we can't.

I hear lots of sentiments like this on the internet:

* "I don't want to be around this person, they're *stupid*."
* "Why would anybody do such an idiotic thing?"
* "Not Invented Here! Not Invented Here! Look who's rewriting the wheel!"
* "**JavaScript**? Why the hell would you write your app in JavaScript?"

This year I was diagnosed with ADHD, and have been learning how to dispell
 the myths of worthlessness others told about me and that I unfortunately
 believed. I want to help JavaScript dismiss myths that experts,
 both from within the JavaScript community and outside it, have perpetuated.

In this talk is a sort of coming-of-age story about learning to embrace failure
 as a tool to constantly improve ourselves and be happier. Logic, pride, and doing
 things The Right Way will take a backseat to honesty, emotions, communication,
 and self-improvement. It's about embracing your style, because somebody else
 probably has that style too. It's about finding what works for you, and
 working with others. It's about putting others up instead of dragging them down.

I'm hoping to dispel some JavaScript dogma as well.

I'll use my own experiences and the life experiences and stories from Walter
 Kirn, Friedrich Nietzche, Bonnie Raitt, John J. Ratey, Edward Hallowell,
 Kent Greenfield, and Captain Planet to open ourselves up to new ideas and new people, and most
 importantly, change our expectations about ourselves.

Also, I'm sorry this is past the deadline.
