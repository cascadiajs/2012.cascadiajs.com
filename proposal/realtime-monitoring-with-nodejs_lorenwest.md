Description
-----------

Stuff happens, and you need to see it.  In this interactive session we'll use
Node.js and open source to build a real time dashboard for monitoring your most
important systems.

Come play with your favorite stars: Node.js, Socket.IO, Backbone, jQuery, and
discover some new talent. Bring your laptops, your wifi, and your favorite
caffiene for this fast paced interactive session.

Then strap on your retro goggles. REPL may make an appearance, and word is she's
back - and lookin' good.

Loren rides the Sounder train into Seattle, and uses that time writing open source
software.  You may have seen him surfing the streets on an [electric skateboard](http://xkcd.com/139/).
