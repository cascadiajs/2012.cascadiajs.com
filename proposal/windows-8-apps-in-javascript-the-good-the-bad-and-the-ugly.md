# Windows 8 Apps in JavaScript: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

* Speaker: Domenic Denicola
* Duration: 30 or 60 minutes

Anders Hejlsberg would have you believe that you cannot build large applications in JavaScript. My team has been proving him false for over two years now, building desktop e-reader software in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. Lately we've turned our efforts toward a Windows 8 application, built, yet again, in these technologies.

This is the story of how we did that, with a focus on the many gaps we filled in the rudimentary framework provided. When creating a serious app, you need to go far beyond the techniques shown in the Microsoft demos. Come learn how we integrated a Node.js build process and module system, used Knockout's two-way databinding, built our own custom unit test harness, and worked around a number of flat-out bugs in the provided libraries.

I develop software and servers for the Nook at [Barnes & Noble.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com). This includes desktop apps written in HTML5 and JavaScript, both for traditional OS's and for Windows 8, as well as Node.js services for those applications. Outside of work, I enjoy taking part in the New York tech scene and contributing to the growing open-source ecosystem surrounding Node.js. Some topics I am passionate about include [promises][], [unit testing][], and the future of the JavaScript language.
