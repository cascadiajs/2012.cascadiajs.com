Description
-----------
When you are starting a new project, you can pick any JS frameworks you want. 
What are the pros and cons of picking a large JS framework like ExtJS versus smaller JS frameworks like EnderJS. How does it affect future development? Features?
At what point do you say, "Hey, I don't really need all of the stuff that this framework offers. I really just need to wire up events."
In this talk, I will talk about what a microJS framework is and I'll give a quick survey of the currently available microjs frameworks. I'll also cover what picking a lot of smaller frameworks versus one big framework means in terms of page load, features, and maintainability.
