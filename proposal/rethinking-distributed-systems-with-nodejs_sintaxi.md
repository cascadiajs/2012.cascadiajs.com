Rethinking Distributed Systems with NodeJS
==========================================

* Speaker   : Brock Whitten
* Available : Nov 8-10th
* Duration  : 30 mins

Description
-----------

I love REST APIs but over the years I have seen a common anti-pattern emerge where we are poorly reimplementing libraries over HTTP APIs. We tend to call these SDKs. The root of the problem is with how the design our our data models is at odds with the design of our interfaces.

Recently, with the creation of the Harp Platform, I have been rethinking this paradigm and I will share with you how we are using tools such as Dnode, Axon, and Thug to keep our system fast, maintainable, and easy to use.
