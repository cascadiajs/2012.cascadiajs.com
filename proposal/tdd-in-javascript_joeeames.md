TDD in JavaScript
========================

* Speaker   : Joe Eames
* Available : Nov 8 and 9
* Duration  : 30-60 mins based on need, or two 30 minute presentations, part 1 and 2

Description
-----------

Test Driven Development has been around for a long time, but rarely do we see it practiced by JavaScript programmers.  A large number of developers think that the only benefit of TDD is the unit tests, but that is simply not true.  Test Driven Development is widely recognized as one of the most effective ways to build code that works and is well factored.  Unfortunately bringing this practice to JavaScript, and especially to client-side JavaScript, offers a wide range of unique challenges.  In this session we won't just discuss TDD as an abstract concept but we will actually learn by doing and build a sample application using Test Driven Development. In addition, we will learn about many of the tools that enable TDD, and how to overcome JavaScript-specific challenges with TDD.  Please come prepared to code.

Note to organizers:
This will be an evolution of a session I gave at the Utah Open Source 2012 conference which you can view here:
