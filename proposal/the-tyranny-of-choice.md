Description
-----------
JS is blowing up exponentially. NPM has over 15,000 packages, 20-30 JS frameworks, myraid of flow controll libraries and 10s of JS conferences daily. More is better right. Not always. I want to explore some or the problems that having so many choices in JS is creating for us and the next generation of programmers and some ways we can go about dealing with this continuing to grow our options.
