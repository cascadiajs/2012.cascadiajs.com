Description

Test-Driven Development has become increasingly important for web developers as Javascript-based web applications become more and more complex. However, TDD is not an easy discipline to master, and doing it well takes a lot of practice and learning. I will first explore and motivate the *one reason* why we do TDD after all: to be able to *code faster*. Then, I will present a set of principles, guidelines, tips and tools to help you optimize for your coding speed when TDD'ing.
