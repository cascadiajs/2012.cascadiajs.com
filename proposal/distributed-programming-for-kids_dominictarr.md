Description
-----------

Games are fun. Friends are fun. Playing games with friends are fun. 
Programming is fun, especially if you are making games. 

However, Distributed Systems (aka, multiplayer games) are hard, right?

...at least, that is what adults will tell you.

The way adults have learned to think about programming local 
systems doesn't work well when distributed systems. But kids don't know that!
so there is nothing stopping them from writing fun distributed systems!

If you grown-ups can refactor your thinking, they can get in on the fun too!
