Description
-----------

Witness why streams are awesome and what happens when you use them everywhere for everything.

We will walk through what the new 0.9 streams look like. We then look at how functional programming with streams plays nicely. Once we have functional programming we can just pile on the abstractions until we have a fully working streaming web application, with all the usual features (reactive, real-time, distributed, peer to peer, etc)
