Description
-----------

Interested in keeping your data real-time?  What if your data is big, as in Big Data? Every website click, device-to-device communication and social media interaction creates valuable data. Lots of it. All the time.  Big Data is raw, detailed, and happening all the time. We'll talk about ingesting, searching and visualizing this real-time data using the power of JavaScript.  From inline scripting in HTML to Backbone.js to Node.js, JavaScript has the power to tame your Big Data and I'll show you how.

big data, whether it is real time or not. He wrote the Splunk JavaScript SDK, as well

who exactly owns who.
