[Make node.js your framework-agnostic worker!]
========================

* Speaker   : [Peter Conerly]
* Available : [Either Day]
* Duration  : [5min / lightning talk]

Description
-----------

I needed to use nodejs as a worker for a js-specific package, but I had already written the website in Django!  The lightning talk will present my trivial redis queueing system to send tasks from Django (or any framework that can access redis) to nodejs.
