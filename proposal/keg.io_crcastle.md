keg.io
======
_arduino- and node.js-enabled kegerator_

* Speaker: Chris Castle
* Available: any time 11/8-11/9, 2012
* Duration: 30 or 60 minutes
* Ideal audience: node.js practitioners, arduino/hardware hobbyists, beer drinkers

keg.io is a technology-laden kegerator project originally developed by Vivaki Nerve Center employees to satisfy their nerdiest beer-drinking needs. It's built on node.js and utilizes an arduino microcontroller to interface with the keg's hardware and sensors.

Come learn how we built it -- from learning about hardware (never soldered _anything_ before this project), to learning Arduino, to the trials and tribulations of debugging hardware and softwareâ€¦ at the same time (fml).  Also I'll talk about how you can get one in your office!

Check out [http://keg.io](http://keg.io) for more details.

Talk Outline
-------------
1. What is it
	- Picture of system, diagram of components
2. Why we built it
	- wanted to learn node, wanted to tinker with hardware, like to play with data, and like drinking beer
3. How we built it
	- v1: node.js talks serial
		- node.js runs on server beside kegerator, serial connection to arduino (i.e. kegerator)
	- v2: node.js goes to the cloud! (persistent, grey Seattle-style)
		- node.js server is an HTTP endpoint at AWS that arduino (i.e. kegerator) talks to
		- server also provides public web-based dashbaord ([keg.io](http://keg.io)) and beer consumption stats API
4. Demo!
	- Hopefully I can bring a built-out kegerator with me.  If not, I can shoot a video for the demo, but it won't be as exciting.  If I do bring one, I can have it setup throughout the conference for people to pour themselves a tasty beer.
5. What's next?
	- Post-pour hooks? (node.js server makes a POST request to custom endpoint when you do a pour)
	- More stats and data visualization
	- Too many ideas!  Really we just want to get to the point where anyone can contribute a small piece to the project.  AND get one setup in every nerdy, developer-filled office we can.
	- We also realize there could be a business opportunity here but haven't explored that too much.
6. Audience Q&A

_Talk length is flexible. I could use 60 minutes (including Q&A) or 30 minutes or, less ideally, could squeeze the talk in to a 10-minute lightning session._

Crude and cynical observer of the world.  Incurable optimist day-to-day.  Tinkers with APIs while consuming IPAs.
