Description
-----------

We often talk about simplicity as something we achieve through subtraction, but Colin Chapman's philosphy of "adding lightness" helps us re-frame the idea so we can be deliberate about designing software that stays simple throughout its life. We'll discuss how this engineer and car designer's ideas can make our software better.
